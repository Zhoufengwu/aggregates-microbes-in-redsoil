# Core Algorithm Manuscript SBB20680 in R: Keystone Species Identification in Microbial Ecology

This repository contains the R code for an ensemble learning algorithm designed for the identification of keystone species in microbial ecology studies. The core algorithm integrates the benefits of Random Forest and Network Analysis methodologies.

## Importance of Random Forest and Network Analysis in Microbial Ecology

Microbial ecology is a field rich in complexity and diversity. Deciphering patterns and processes in microbial communities necessitates methods capable of managing vast quantities of data and extracting meaningful insights. Random Forest and Network Analysis methodologies are crucial in this context.

**Random Forest** is a robust machine learning technique utilized for handling intricate data structures. It is adept at dealing with a substantial number of predictor variables, even when complex interactions and non-linear relationships are present. This makes it particularly suitable for handling microbial ecology data.

**Network Analysis**, in contrast, provides a quantitative and visual method to investigate intricate relationships between different microbial species within an ecosystem. It can unveil community structures, interactions, and keystone species, all of which are crucial for understanding the ecological roles of microbes.

By combining both methodologies into an ensemble learning framework, we can take advantage of each method's strengths to build more accurate and robust models of microbial ecology. More importantly, this approach enhances our ability to identify and understand the role of keystone species in microbial communities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the algorithm on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You should have R installed on your computer.

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a directory named 'test' in the root of the cloned repository.
3. Place your input mapping file and ASV table into the 'test' folder.

### Running the Code

With your input files in the 'test' directory, you can now run the R code. Navigate to the directory containing the R script in a terminal and type `Rscript script_name.R` (replace "script_name.R" with the name of the script you want to run).
