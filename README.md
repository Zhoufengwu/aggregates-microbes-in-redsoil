# Core Algorithm of "Ensemble learning algorithms to elucidate the core microbiome's impact on carbon content and degradation properties at the soil aggregate level" in R: Keystone Species Identification in Microbial Ecology

This repository contains the R code for an ensemble learning algorithm designed for the identification of keystone species in microbial ecology studies. The core algorithm integrates the benefits of Random Forest and Network Analysis methodologies.

## Importance of Random Forest and Network Analysis in Microbial Ecology

Microbial ecology is a field rich in complexity and diversity. Deciphering patterns and processes in microbial communities necessitates methods capable of managing vast quantities of data and extracting meaningful insights. Random Forest and Network Analysis methodologies are crucial in this context.

**Random Forest** is a robust machine learning technique utilized for handling intricate data structures. It is adept at dealing with a substantial number of predictor variables, even when complex interactions and non-linear relationships are present. This makes it particularly suitable for handling microbial ecology data.

**Network Analysis**, in contrast, provides a quantitative and visual method to investigate intricate relationships between different microbial species within an ecosystem. It can unveil community structures, interactions, and keystone species, all of which are crucial for understanding the ecological roles of microbes.

By combining both methodologies into an ensemble learning framework, we can take advantage of each method's strengths to build more accurate and robust models of microbial ecology. More importantly, this approach enhances our ability to identify and understand the role of keystone species in microbial communities.
